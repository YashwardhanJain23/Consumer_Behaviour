# eCommerce Customer Analysis with R

This project explores an eCommerce customer dataset to derive insights into customer behavior, segmentation, and churn rate using R.

## Overview

The analysis focuses on understanding various aspects of customer behavior and patterns within an eCommerce platform using R. It includes:

- **Browsing Behavior Analysis:** Investigates the relationship between product browsing time and total pages viewed.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Utilizes Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to segment customers into Low, Medium, and High Value categories.
- **Churn Rate Calculation:** Determines the proportion of customers with no purchases.

## Data

The dataset used for analysis contains information about eCommerce customers, including attributes such as age, gender, browsing behavior, total purchases, and device type.

## Files

- `analysis.R`: R script containing the analysis conducted.
- `ecommerce_customer_data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.

## Analysis

- Conducted using R to explore various aspects of customer behavior and trends within the dataset.
- Utilized R libraries such as `dplyr`, `plotly`, and `tidyr` for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## Results

- No consistent pattern found between browsing time and total pages viewed.
- Segmentation into Low, Medium, and High Value customers based on CLV.
- Churn rate calculated at approximately 19.8%.

## Conclusion

The insights gained from this R-based analysis can inform strategies for customer engagement, marketing efforts, and retention strategies aimed at sustained business growth.
